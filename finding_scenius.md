# Finding scenius

The artist Brian Eno has
[introduced](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
a notion of collective intelligence that he calls "scenius":

> "Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole
> cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the
> genius."

Kevin Kelly has a
[stimulating blog post](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
in which he discusses what scenius is, and proposes some ideas about
how it's nurtured:

> Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and
> produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like
> genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire
> you.

As an example, conside the town of Florence in the 15th century.  At
the time it had perhaps 100,000 inhabitants.  That's a tiny number,
but included Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico,
Donatello, and a host of lesser but still great painters.

How remarkable a clustering of painters was this?

Numerical attempts to value creative work are always arguable, and I
don't want to get caught up in arguing over details.  However, let us
conservatively grant that several of these painters would be listed
among the 100 greatest painters of all time.  For example, four of
them appear on
[this list](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/most-important-painters.htm).
A modern country of, say, 100 million inhabitants, might, if it were
lucky, produce more than four painters of such quality in a century.
But it is almost inconceivable that it would produce (say) 40 such
painters.

In other words, if you were an artist who aspired to be considered a
great painter, you upped your chances by a factor of perhaps a
thousand by the good fortune of being born in Florence in the 15th
century, rather than (say) in North America in the 20th century.

We often think in terms of people such as Michaelangelo, Botticelli
_et al_ being born with extraordinary, one in a million (or more)
levels of talent.  But the lesson of Florence is that this is wrong.
These people were more like one in 10,000 types of talent.  Indeed,
they were probably far less: after all, painting was closed as a
career to the great majority of Florentines, most of whom were of the
wrong gender, or too poor, or faced some other near-insurmountable
barrier.

What truly set Michaelangelo _et al_ apart wasn't talent.  It was
their great good fortune in being in the right place at the right
time.  Their genius derived from scenius.

## Is scenius really the _cause_ of genius?

Can we really claim that scenius _caused_ Florence's 15th century
outbreak of artistic genius?  Maybe some other causal factor was
responsible?

To see what I mean, consider a case where it _seems_ as though scenius
was occurring, but upon closer examination that explanation seems
unlikely.  The example is the project to build the atomic bomb,
carried out in the small town of Los Alamos during World War II.
Living in town at the time were scientific luminaries such Feynman,
Fermi, Bethe, and (on occasion) Bohr and von Neumann, as well many
other scientists and engineers of great distinction.

This is a galaxy of talent not unlike Florence in the 15th century.
But, of course, the environment in Los Alamos did not _create_ such
talent.  Most of the luminaries in town were already exceptionally
accomplished before going to Los Alamos.  Perhaps the environment did
make some positive difference to their future accomplishments, but it
seems unlikely that it was primarily the environment which caused
their future accomplishments.

By contrast, the great painters of Florence named above were all born
in Florence, or in the countryside nearby.  And so it really was
living in Florence during the 15th century which _caused_ these people
to become better painters.

I suspect that many other examples of supposed scenius are more like
Los Alamos -- great aggregations of talent that will flourish no
matter what -- than Florence, where just being in Florence at the
right time seemed to help produce much better creative work.  I
suspect this is at least partially true of
[Bloomsbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group), for
example, and of the [Inklings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings).

## Was Florence just at the tail end of the distribution?

Another way of countering the scenius hypothesis is to wonder whether
ordinary statistical variation might explain the existence of a town
like Florence.  After all, the world has contained many communities of
100,000 people through history.  And some of those communities will
contain an unusually large number of excellent artists, just by the
luck of the draw.  Maybe the reason for Florence's success wasn't
scenius, it was luck. _Some_ community had to have the most great
artists, and maybe it just happened to be Florence.

In the appendix I use a statistical model to test the idea that
Florence was just lucky.  In particular, I test the _genius
hypothesis_, the idea that what makes a great artist such as
Michaelangelo is some intrinsic property of the artist, not the
environment in which he found himself.  According to this hypothesis,
Michaelangelo could have been brought up in another small town of
100,000 and, provided the town had some sort of artistic community, he
would still have matured into a great artist.

What I show in the appendix is that it's not possible to account for
the creativity we find in Florence, even by the luck of the draw.
Instead, we must take seriously the _scenius hypothesis_, i.e., the
notion that while intrinsic properties are important, the environment
in which a creative type works may be far more important.

## Maybe Florence was just the right place at the right time?

Imagine it is the 18th century.  You are living in New York and you
hear the first news of a major gold strike in California.  Many people
rush out to California, dig for gold, and an unusually large fraction
become wealthy.  Should we conclude from this that there was some
special scenius in California that imbued those people with a special
talent for generating wealth?  Were they picking up special
wealth-generating skills from their friends and colleagues?

The answer, obviously, is no, it would be wrong to attribute the
wealth to anything particularly important in the social environment.
Rather, they chose to put themselves in the right place at the right
time.

You can make a similar case for Florence.  There is a sense in which
the 15th century Florence was a rich frontier waiting to be mined for
great art, not unlike the mining of gold in the California gold
fields.  At least three factors contributed to Florence being such a
frontier: (1) it had been a leading European center for art for
hundreds of years; (2) the rise of the Medici family created a
business model to support a large number of artistic endeavours; and
(3) the ideas, techniques and technologies of art had advanced to a
point where they opened up a whole new world of artistic
possibilities.

Any one of these three facts would not have been enough to establish
Florence as pre-eminent not just in its time, but arguably for all
time.  But with all three factors occurring simultaneously, Florence
became _the place_ to be for ambitious artists.

This explanation for Florence's pre-eminence is subtly different from
Eno's explanation of scenius.  It's not that the great painters of
Florence were learning and benefiting from each other.  Instead, in
this explanation they were more like gold miners who just happened to
be first on the scene, just as a new vein of gold was found.

This is what might be called the _rich frontier_ hypothesis of genius:
there's a huge advantage to getting in very early as a rich frontier
is opening up.  There are relatively few other people present
initially, and so not only pioneers stake a major claim, they're often
able to remain ahead of the curve for many years or decades, even as
the field matures.

So now we have an interesting question.  How much were the great
Florentine artists benefiting from being at a rich frontier, and how
much were they benefiting from a rich social environment?  I don't
think it's at all clear what he answer to this question is.

How does this affect our notion of scenius? 

There are two paths we could take at this point.  One is to adopt a
narrow notion of scenius as the benefit a creative worker gets from
their social scene.  I'm prety sure this is how Eno intended it, and
it's certainly how Kevin Kelly discusses it.  If we adopt this notion
of scenius then it explicitly excludes the rich frontier.  Any attempt
to explain Florence and similar events must engage the question of the
relative contribution of both scenius and the rich frontier.

The other approach is to embrace a broader notion of scenius which
includes both the benefits from working at a rich frontier _and_ the
benefit from a rich social environment.  In this essay, I'm going to
adopt this broader notion of scenius.  I'll still occasionally find it
helpful to break out both components of scenius --- the rich frontier
and the rich social scene.

A lot of what I've said so far seems like bland truisms. Yes,
environment matters.  Yes, being in the right place at the right time
matters.  Everyone can trivially agree with these statements.  But
they acquire force when contrasted with other supposely obvious
truisms.  Most people think great creative achievement requires
supreme talent.  But the moral of the Florence Renaissance is that
it's better to be moderately talented and in the right place at the
right time than it is to be supremely talented and in the wrong place
at the wrong time.  

In a sense, I think this over-emphasis we have on talent is utterly
destructive.  It's not a myth, exactly --- there are certainly
different levels of talent.  But we overemphasize it at the expense of
other, more important things.  If Michaelangelo had grown up in a
Florence-sized town day, he'd be a well-known local artist, admired
within a small sphere, but forgotten by history [1].

  
# How to find scenius

Where is scenius nascent today?

It's tempting to think scenius must be in the high-prestige,
fashionable, or rich fields or organizations. Just look at all the
books and glossy magazine articles which have been written extolling
the virtues of Google, Apple, private space ventures, and so on (fill
in your favourite example here!)  If you believe what's written, these
places are creative nirvana.

I think it's quite a bit more complicated than the laudatory publicity
suggests.

I've no doubt Google, say, has many good or even great engineers.  But
at the same time I doubt there are many parts of the organization
which match the intensity of good ideas produced by Bell Labs, Xerox
PARC, or the MIT AI Lab in their heyday.  Why is that?  And how can we
find those places today?

I think it's worth understanding

One problem is that when a field becomes prestigious or fashionable,
or a lot of money is available, then people who just want to coast
arrive in droves.  It requires high barriers to keep those people out.
  
Walter Isaacson's
[recent biography of Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537)
makes it clear that one of Jobs's main functions at Apple was to act
as a human barrier, either firing or driving away people who weren't
superb at their job.  This no doubt had many negative consequences.
But it's also part of the reason Apple maintained a very good core
team, despite being high prestige.
  
An advantage of being high prestige is that also attracts many very
smart, very determined people will be interested in participating.
The problem is that those people will be a tiny subset of an avalanche
of others.  Creating a great environment will require very good
filters, both in terms of who you accept, and in terms of who you
drive away.
    
The counter-argument is that lots of very smart, very determined
people will also be in these fields.  My gut feeling is that while
this is true, the density becomes relatively low.  Not as low as in
many other fields, of course, but it's not amazing: it's not Florence
in the 1400s, or Los Alamos in the 1940s.


What really matters: the density of people 


I don't know where scenius is nascent today.  I have my suspicions.
  Very interesting areas include: robotics, 3d-printing, energy,
  space, synthetic biology, gaming, virtual worlds, self-driving cars,
  augmented reality, the maker and DIY movements.
  
  Most probably it's in areas edgier than any of these, areas I've
  never heard of.

  But identifying promising subject areas is not the same as
  identifying high-concentration communities doing great work.
  
  Part of the problem is public relations.  It's easy to be wowed by
  the pubicity coming from an organization such as SpaceX.  And maybe
  it really is a great place, a place that is enabling its engineers
  and scientists to grow by leaps and bounds.  Equally well, maybe
  it's all a few brilliant engineers, and everyone else is a drone.
  It's hard to know from the outside.




**What am I trying to do in the essay?** I'm not sure.  Partially I'm
  just exploring a fascinating phenomenon for anyone interested in
  human achievement or human institutions: the clustering of talent.
  Why does it happen?  What does it mean?  Are there interesting
  hypotheses about the clustering that we can rule in or out?

  Partially I'm interested for much more personal reasons. I'm trying
  to figure out what _I_ should be doing.  There are two problems with
  this: (1) it's very personal, and it's hard to write about personal
  stuff; and (2) it's incomplete: am I writing about scenius, or about
  how to choose work?  Because of this there is a natural pull to make
  this merely _part_ of a much larger and more ambitious essay on how
  to choose work.  But that feels like more than I can or want to bite
  off at present.
  
  Partially I'm interested in the question as an institutional design
  problem.
  
  I'm left in an uncomfortable position: I have what seem like many
  interesting observations.  But I don't have a natural frame to put
  them in.
  
  One possibility would be just to stop, to make the first part of the
  essay, above, the entirety of the essay, with some re-organization.
  But I feel like I can do better.
  
  Another possibility: just go with something cheap: "Five signs of
  scenius" or something like that.  Or maybe "Five signs you haven't
  found scenius".  I'm perhaps trying too hard to find a narrative
  thread, and should instead just tie things up, and let it go.


  


**A corollary to the above is to look for communities that are held
 together by something other than fashion, money, or prestige:**
 Often, they'll be held together by a shared ideal, or something else
 that is shared.  It may just be shared awareness of a frontier.
 
An example is the case of Camp 4 at Yosemite.  Climbers at Camp 4 will
often make a living by collecting and recycling aluminium
cans. They'll live off boiled rice and peanut butter.  They're not
doing it for the money.  And they're not doing it because it's
fashionable or prestigious in the wider society.  Rather, they have a
shared ideal of what matters, and they believe so strongly in it that
they're willing to live this way, pushing the frontier of climbing.

**Is there a rich frontier to mine?** Think of painting at the end of
  the 15th century.  Painting at the start of the 20th.  Quantum
  computing in the early 1990s.  Physics in the 1920s.  The internet
  (especially the web) in the 1990s.  Possibly also today.  In each
  case there were major frontiers on which it had become possible to
  make rapid progress.


## Appendix: Isn't it a waste of time to talk about these silly, soft
## things?

There's a best-selling self-help book by Steven Covey entitled "The
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People".  It's about what you'd
expect --- advice on how to live a better and more effective life.
Linus Torvalds once
[stated his opinion](http://lwn.net/Articles/105375/) of Covey's book
in no uncertain terms:

> I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly Successful People", and
> NOT read it.  Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture.
  
Torvalds's comment illustrates the attitude many technical people have
about discussions of "soft" human-centred subjects.  And I'm acutely
aware that the current essay on scenius fits this bill just as much as
do the subjects of books such as Covery's.  We don't yet have a
science which answers questions such as how to spend one's time, how
to deal with your spouse, how to create a great creative scene, and so
on.  But such questions still matter, and so self-help books rack up
millions of sales.
  
Many in the intellectual elite sneer at such self-help as
witch-doctory.  "It's not real science", they say.  True.  But, and
here's the rub, they _can't point to obviously superior solutions_.
And the problem is that just because we don't yet have a good science
of how to live, doesn't mean we get to opt out of questions like how
to live a happy and interesting life.  The right question isn't
whether Covey and his ilk are witch doctors.  Rather, when you only
have witch doctors to choose from, you want to make darn sure you find
the best witch doctor available.

This phenomenon has led to something interesting: psychologists are
colonzizing self-help, writing books using the fact that they're REAL
SCIENCE as a marketing credential.  Unfortunately, the results are
often oversold, the evidence and reasoning little better than in any
other books.  In another century or two I expect we'll genuinely
_know_ a lot about these sorts of questions.  But for now, the
"scientific" self-help books seem little more trustworthy than any
other.  We're stuck trying to find high quality witch doctors,
regardless of whether they have PhDs, MDs, or simply a charismatic
personality and writing style.

For all these reasons I was somewhat hesitant to write this essay.
I'm well aware that we're still at the stage of just-so stories in
understanding things like scenius.  Still, I believe that it's worth
thinking hard about, no matter how imperfect and uncertain the results
may be.  Just because a question is difficult is no reason to refrain
from attempting to answer it.

## Appendix: Was Florence a statistical fluke?

Suppose we assume the genius hypothesis as true, and believe that
someone will achieve greatness as a painter with a fixed probability,
say p = 1 in ten million, independent of their environment.  Then in a
community of n = 100,000 people, the probability of having k or more
great painters (k a small positive integer) is approximately:
  
(np)^k / k! = (1/100)^k / k!
  
When k = 4, this probability is less than one in a billion.  And so if
the genius hypothesis is true, then Florence is far outside the bounds
of what can be expected statistically.
  
Of course, the outcome here depends a lot on exactly what we mean for
a painter to be "great".  If we adopt more modest standards, say p = 1
in a million, then the probability above increases quite a bit, to
about 1 in a quarter million.  This is still too small -- there have
not been anything like a quarter million such communities in history
-- but is at least getting closer to statistical plausibility.  The
problem is that if we adopt this value of p, then we're saying that we
expect a great painter to emerge from about 1 city in every 10 of size
100,000.  While some notable painters will likely come out of such a
collection of cities, I frankly think that's far too modest a
criterion.  So we can confidently reject the genius hypothesis.

## Appendix: Is the internet still a rich frontier?

Over the past decade I've heard many people say that the internet is
over, and that the great emerging frontier is clean energy, or space,
_etc_.

My instinct is that these people are wrong.  Not wrong to say that
clean energy and space are great emerging frontiers; they certainly
are.  But wrong to think that the internet is over.
  
There are huge problems that remain to be solved online.  We're a long
way from networking every object and every event in the world.  We're
drowning in human co-ordination problems.  We're drowning in data
analysis problems.  And we're still a long way from artificial
intelligence.
  
Maybe there's insurmountable bottlenecks that will stop progress
toward all these goals.  But, at least today, progress on each
continues to hum along, and convincing bottlenecks hard to spot.  To
paraphrase
[Alan Kay](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf), the real
internet revolution hasn't happened yet.
	  
One sign of this is the many low-hanging fruit which remain.  

For instance, it shocks me how little work there is on developing new
internet protocols and new server and client software.  Danny Hillis
once [observed](http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Hillis.html)
that the web --- i.e., the http protocol --- is "the slime mold of the
Internet".  

That summary seems exactly right.  Sure, the web and other existing
protocols such as email and so on are neat.  But it's not as though
we've done more than begin exploring what can be done with distributed
user interfaces.  Few communities are even exploring this in depth.
One which is is the online gaming community, and games such as World
of Warcraft start to show how remarkable distributed user interfaces
can be.  But while that work is interesting, it's not leading to new
open platforms.  We only see a trickle of work on developing new open
platforms --- things like
[BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and
[SPDY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY).  Those things are great,
but there's much less than I'd _a priori_ expect.

# Footnotes

[1] I wonder about the importance of feedback effects.  The Florentine
  Michaelangelo must at some point have realized that he had an
  opportunity to be one of the great artists of all time.  That may
  well have motivated him to work far harder (and thus become a better
  artist) than if all he could hope for was to be a well-known local
  artist.  The best way to sail is with the wind at your back.

# Attempt

> _I look at the edge to see where the center is going._ --
> [Stewart Brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) [*], one
> of our best scenius hounds.

I'm interested in scenius for an intensely personal reason.  I'm
exploring new projects, and so I'm thinking about how to find good,
fun projects to work on.  Scenius isn't my only criterion, but it's on
my mind.  All other things being equal, I'd rather work at a rich,
underpopulated frontier, in a fantastic environment that will buoy me
up, that will make me smarter.
 
So I'm asking myself the question: where is scenius nascent today?
And one thing I've realized is that I don't have more than a vague
idea of the answer.
  
Sure, I know of many emerging fields that are interesting.  A partial
list, in no particular order, includes 3d printing, synthetic biology,
connectomics, gaming and virtual worlds, open science, robotics,
self-driving cars, space, augmented reality, wearable computing,
online education, cognitive tools, the maker and DIY movements.  There
are also corners of big data, machine learning and programming
language design that are interesting.
  
But looking at that list, most of the things on it are pretty
mainstream.  Once an idea has appeared on ted.com, it's no longer at
the edge, it's moving toward the middle.  And going mainstream dilutes
scenius.  People rush in as money and prestige become available.  This
increases the density of several types of people: people who just want
to coast, riding the coattails of pioneers; people whose main interest
is money and prestige; and people who only work on the conventional.
None of these promotes scenius.  Meanwhile, the scope of the frontier
--- of the
[adjacent possible](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838.html),
in Stephen Johnson's wonderful useage --- expands far more slowly than
the inrush of people. People sense that their piece of the creative
pie is becoming smaller, even as their access to resources increases.
They become more competitive, less willing to boost others up.

A particularly pernicious form of this is our cultural obsession with
high-prestige, fashionable, or rich fields and organizations.

Just look at all the books and glossy magazine articles which have
been written extolling the virtues of Google, private space ventures,
Apple, open education, and so on -- you can fill in your own examples
here!  If you believe what's written these fields and organizations
are creative nirvana.

I think it's quite a bit more complicated than the laudatory publicity
suggests.

I've no doubt Google, say, has many good and even great engineers.
But at the same time I doubt there are more than few small parts of
the organization today which match the intensity of good ideas
produced by Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, and the MIT AI Lab in their heyday.
In the early days, no question --- Google was a relatively small
company which produced search, gmail, fundaental systems for
distributed computing.  But today, even as Google has grown by orders
of magnitude, the rate of major innovations has not correspondingly
increased.  Their success has created a major inrush of people into
the company, and made it a fashionable, high-prestige place to be.
But most of those people are working to maintain and incrementally
improve what GOogle already does.  And so the density of scenius
across the company has inevitably decreased.

An interesting question is whether there are corners of the company
which are just as remarkable as the early Google?  I don't know.  But
events such as Google Wave's failure are encouraging.  It was a huge,
swing-for-the-fences idea that contained a lot of good ideas, and
arguably very nearly worked.  If Google continues developing such
ideas, then it seems likely to me that they'll sometimes swing for the
fences and succeed.



There's a lot to be said about the characteristics are of scenius.

+ **A high density of dedicated people:** As I've argued above, they
  don't need to be supremely talented, but they must be dedicated, and
  ambitious to create.  Michaelangelo wasn't coasting.

+ **The creative frontier is large, relative to the number of people
  involved:** This is pretty vague. A field that is fun and ripe if
  just 50 people are involved may be overcrowded if 5,000 people are
  involved.  People start to get squeezed into tiny little boxes,
  pursuing tiny dreams.  Furthermore, people start to _feel_ as though
  there is more competition, even if there are actually more resources
  per capita.  The result is that they can become more selfish,
  restricting the flow of information.  You feel less buoyed by
  others.  I had an experience like this: I worked in quantum
  computing from 1992 through 2007.  And even though far more
  resources were available per person to do quantum computing in 2007,
  the field also felt (to me) like it was much more competitive,
  because while the number of people had exploded, the intellectual
  frontier had not.

So I will conclude this main part of my essay by asking my readers:
where is scenius nascent today?  This is really a few different
questions:

+ **What are the most important emerging fields?** Typically, these
are fields that have just opened up because of some other advance or
advances.

+ **Where are the best environments to work in?  Why?** Beware the
distinction between great PR and branding, and real success.  MIT is a
great brand, but

Not the
name-brand institutions:


This essay has not one but three appendices.  It's an unusual
structure: they're mini-essays that didn't fit into .  I could have
spun them out into separate blog posts, but


# Notes

"I look to the edges to see where the center is going."

Why am I writing this?  It's mostly because I'm bugged by the
question: where is scenius nascent today?  I've been asking myself
this for a long time, and I'm not happy with my answers.

Sure, I know of many emerging fields that are interesting.  A partial
list might include 3d printing, synthetic biology, gaming and virtual
worlds, robotics, connectomics, self-driving cars, augmented reality,
wearable computing, the maker and DIY movements.

But looking at that list, two thoughts strike me.  First, I don't know
where the best places are for these things.  And second, all the
things on that list are pretty mainstream.  And, as I discuss below,
there are good reasons that the more mainstream an idea becomes, the
less scenius is involved.  Once an idea has appeared on ted.com, it's
no longer at the edge, it's moving toward the middle.
  
**Scenius radar:** Some people have amazing scenius radar.  Consider
Stewart Brand. Here's a list of fields, institutions and people he
identified _before_ they became famous: Doug Engelbart, LSD, ecology,
the Grateful Dead, Xerox PARC, Paul Ehrlich, the hippy movement.  That
list could be continued almost _ad infinitum_; over the last fifty
years if you wanted to know "What's interesting?" then you could do a
lot worse than answer "Whatever Stewart Brand is paying attention to
right now".

I don't know how Brand did this.  But I'll bet it helped that he ran
the Whole Earth Catalog.  It's purpose was pretty much to _find_ the
most interesting stuff going on.

**The tension between exploration and deep work:** Very few people are
  good at finding scenius.  And to do so they need to explore a lot.
  They become journalists --- like the people working on the Whole
  Earth Catalog.  And there's a real tension between such exploration
  and doing deep creative work.  Do I really believe this?  Brand and
  several of the other Whole Earthers have done deep work.  Maybe it's
  a question of alternating.  Maybe you spend some time doing a
  "reconaissance in force" of several areas, writing articles, doing
  interviews, trying to find the interesting edges.  And then you pick
  a deep project to commit to, something that will take a few years.
  I think it was Chandrasekhar who said that it took two years to do
  significant work, so he kept changing fields every two years, and
  then picking some new and important problem to be working on.

**Prestige and fashion:** One problem is that when a field becomes
prestigious or fashionable, or a lot of money is available, then
people who just want to coast arrive in droves.  It requires high
barriers to keep those people out.
  
**Jobs and high barriers:** Walter Isaacson's
[recent biography of Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537)
makes it clear that one of Jobs's main functions at Apple was to act
as a human barrier, either firing or driving away people who weren't
superb at their job.  This no doubt had many negative consequences.
But it's also part of the reason Apple maintained a very good core
team, despite being high prestige.

**Open, but with high standards:** Anyone can join.  But they may have
  to pay a price.  Furthermore, their work will ultimately be judged
  by very high standards.  Those standards are ultimately grounded in
  something meaningful to the outside field, not merely the internal
  politics of the field.  I've seen academic and artistic communities
  become a prisoner to their internal politics.  It's a bad sign when
  you frequently hear people's work being criticised on the grounds
  that "It's not foo fizzle pop", where "foo fizzle pop" seems only
  meaningful to insiders.

**Open, but with ruthless standards:** Or maybe the right way of
  thinking.  It's an old observation that there is no democracy of
  talent.  More important, to my mind, is that there there's no
  democracy of...

**Advantage of being high prestige:** An advantage of being high
prestige is that also attracts many very smart, very determined people
will be interested in participating.  The problem is that those people
will be a tiny subset of an avalanche of others.  Creating a great
environment will require very good filters, both in terms of who you
accept, and in terms of who you drive away.
    
The counter-argument is that lots of very smart, very determined
people will also be in these fields.  My gut feeling is that while
this is true, the density becomes relatively low.  Not as low as in
many other fields, of course, but it's not amazing: it's not Florence
in the 1400s, or Los Alamos in the 1940s.

**I there really anything at all to the notion of scenius?** Even the
  term sounds kind of vague and wishy-washy.  It also has the problem
  that for most people it's not very concrete.  They've never had the
  experience. They don't know what it feels like to be inside a
  fantastic scene.  Richard Feynman's story of running into Max
  Delbruck(?), and why he stayed at Caltech.

**The right types of failure are encouraged:** This is just an
  instinctive comment.  I feel like some types of failure are
  punished, while others are rewarded.  When a scene is still small,
  people know each other.  They know when someone is a foolish dreamer
  with low standards, and when someone is a smart dreamer who holds
  themself to high standards.  And the latter will be forgiven when
  they come up short.  Indeed, they may even be celebrated.  And, in
  moderation, that's not a bad thing.
    
**Ownership at the edges, not at the center:** I suspect it matters
that things like Unix and C were produced by XXX, not by "Bell Labs".



**The characteristics of scenius:** Kelly has a list.  It's mismatched
  to mine, since he has a different conception of scenius.  I'd change
  his list anyway.  But for my approach, which splits scenius into two
  pieces, a different type of list is needed anyway.
  
  
**Choose a rich, underpopulated frontier.  And then find a community
where very smart people are helping one another open that frontier.**
A difficult balancing act then ensues.  You need to both learn as much
as possible from those people, but also to begin developing your own
identity.

What you want: a high density of dedicated people pursuing a rich
frontier.  And you want the size of the frontier to dwarf the number
of people involved.

**Phil Agre:** The information scientist Phil Agre has proposed an
  interesting way to identify important emerging fields. He suggested
  asking the very smartest undergrads what they're interested in, and
  making a list of their replies. Cross the already fashionable
  answers (cosmology, nanotech etc) off the list. Look instead for
  fields that you've never heard of, that sound strange, and slightly
  off the wall. Some of those fields will fail, of course. But chances
  are that some of biggest fields a decade or two hence will be on
  that list.

**How to recognize scenius?**

**What's going to be important in 10-15 years' time? Are there
  high-concentration communities doing interesting work in the area
  today?** Space, robotics, energy.


**The adjacent possible:**

**Teleportation was the adjacent possible for a long, long time:**
  It's tempting to think this is just about low-haning fruit.  But
  it's not.  Quantum teleportation is a simple enough protocol that it
  could have been discovered in the 1920s.  But it wasn't.  It had to
  wait until 1993.

 
**What isn't scenius?** If something is fashionable or there's lots of
  money to do it (or both).  This causes an inrush of poseurs and
  9-to-5ers.  

**What about the developing world?**

**What about ideas outside this narrow set?** I'm painfully aware 

**Academia?**

**Public intellectualism**

**What should I actually do?** Maybe write a series of articles.
  Frankly, I think it's actually.  Maybe more agressively link.  Ask
  people for their ideas of where scenius is to be found?  I think
  there's that alternating series.  Go into fields where you are a
  learner.  Look for young people to learn from --- they don't suffer
  so much either from the sunk cost fallacy, or from bad network
  effects.

**However, there may still be identifiable sub-veins within those
  locations:** This is an interesting question.  Going in an _ad hoc_
  fashion to the big, fashionable places doesn't work.  But maybe if
  you have inside information, you can find great, innovative groups
  inside an organization or field.

**It doesn't come out of companies:** I wonder. Many of
  Michaelangelo's greatest works were, of course, produced on
  commission.  I think a problem with companies is that people in them
  often don't get the credit for what they do, and they often have to
  fit into someone else's tighty controlled narrative.  Neither is
  good for doing excellent work.
    

**Brainstorming questions:** How to find scenius?  Where is scenius
  today?  How to create scenius?  I have a practical question: what
  impact should it have?  

There are two natural questions to ask at this point.  If you are
still not yet decided on a career, and ambitious to do great creative
work, then you should ask **how to find scenius**.  After all, what
else increases your chance of doing great things by a factor of 1,000
or more?  The second natural question is **how to create scenius**?
Although I have many thoughts about the second question, I am going to
focus on the first.

The question then becomes: **how to find scenius?** And to answer
that, the we can ask **Where is scenius today?** Let's look first at
the related question: **what are some examples of scenius in recent
times?** Here's a few that seem like likely candidates:
  
+ In the 1970s
  [Xerox PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)) made
  crucial contributions to the development of laser printers, the
  mouse, windowing systems (and graphics more generally), the
  ethernet, and many more.

+ Pixar: 11 of Pixar's 12 feature films have been critical and
financial successes.  For the most part they're not to my taste, but
clearly Pixar has figured out something which virtually none of the
other studios have.

**Paypal as an example?**

**Might it only be founders-only?** Maybe **early-employees only?** Is
  there much evidence for that?
  
**Do you need some selection process for quality?** Yes, a ruthless
  one.  Ideally, one that will concentrate the best people in the same
  locations, but at the same time not dissuade them from being
  friendly with one another, and supporting one another.
