# Finding scenius

_Rough working notes on scenius._

The artist Brian Eno has
[introduced](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
a notion of collective intelligence that he calls "scenius":

> "Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole
> cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the
> genius."

It's not difficult to think of examples of scenius.  

Florence in the 15th century had approximately 100,000 inhabitants.
The people born in (or just outside) Florence in that time include
Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Donatello, and a
host of lesser but still great painters.

How great a clustering of painters was this?

Numerical attempts to value creative work are always arguable, and I
don't want to get caught up in arguing over details.  However, let us
conservatively grant that several of these painters could be listed
among the 100 greatest painters of all time.  For example, four of
them appear on
[this list](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/most-important-painters.htm).
A modern country of, say, 100 million inhabitants, might, if it were
lucky, produce more than four painters of such quality during a
century.  But it is almost inconceivable that it would produce (say)
40 such painters.

In other words, if you were an artist who aspired to be considered a
great painter, you upped your chances by a factor of perhaps a
thousand by the good fortune of being born in Florence in the 15th
century, rather than (say) in North American in the 20th century.

We often think in terms of people such as Michaelangelo, Botticelli
_et al_ being born with extraordinary, one in a hundred million levels
of talent.  But the lesson of Florence is that this is false.  These
people were, at most, one in 10,000 types of talent.  Indeed, they
were probably far less: after all, painting was closed as a career to
the great majority of Florentines, most of whom were of the wrong
gender, or too poor, or had some other barrier.  

What truly set Michaelangelo _et al_ apart wasn't talent.  It was
their great good fortune in being in the right place at the right
time.  Their genius derived from scenius.

**Scenius is not merely a statistical fluke:** Might there be some way
avoid this conclusion that the genius of the Florentines derived from
scenius?  For example, you might wonder whether Florence was, perhaps,
just a statistical fluke?  After all, no matter the importance of
scenius, some otherwise unremarkable communities will contain an
excess of artists, just by the luck of the draw.  Maybe the key to
Florence's success wasn't scenius, it was simply luck.

In the appendix to these notes I set up a simple statistical model to
test the idea that Florence was just lucky.  In particular, I test the
_genius hypothesis_, the idea that what makes someone like
Michaelangelo great is some intrinsic property of that person.
According to this hypothesis, he could have been brought up in another
small town of 100,000 and, provided the town had some sort of artistic
community, he still would have matured into a great artist.  In the
appendix I show that the creativity we find in Florence cannot be
accounted for by the genius hypothesis, even by the luck of the draw.
Instead, it seems that we must take seriously the _scenius
hypothesis_, which states that while intrinsic properties are
important, the environment in which a creative type works may be even
more important.

**Wasn't it just that Florence was the right place at the right
  time?** In this explanation, we say that a few things came together:
  (1) the ideas, techniques and technologies of art had advanced to a
  point where it opened up a whole new world of artistic
  possibilities; (2) Florence already had a community of artists who
  were already on the leading edge (true); and (3) the success of the
  Medici and other families created a business model to support
  artistic endeavours.

**Scenius is causative:** An interesting contrast to Florence is the
small town of Los Alamos during World War II.  Living in the town were
scientific luminaries such Feynman, Fermi, Bethe, and (on occasion)
Bohr and von Neumann.

This is a galaxy of talent not unlike Florence in the 15th century.
But, of course, the environment in Los Alamos did not _create_ such
talent.  Most of the luminaries in town were already exceptionally
accomplished _before_ going to Los Alamos.  Perhaps the environment
did make some positive difference to their future accomplishments, but
it seems unlikely that it was primarily the environment which caused
their future accomplishments.

By contrast, the great painters of Florence named above were all born
in Florence, or in the countryside nearby.  And so it really was
living in Florence during the 15th century which helped _cause_ these
people to become much better painters.
  

# How to find scenius

There are two natural questions to ask at this point.  If you are
still not yet decided on a career, and ambitious to do great creative
work, then you should ask **how to find scenius**.  After all, what
else increases your chance of doing great things by a factor of 1,000
or more?  The second natural question is **how to create scenius**?
Although I have many thoughts about the second question, I am going to
focus on the first.

The question then becomes: **how to find scenius?** And to answer
that, the we can ask **Where is scenius today?** Let's look first at
the related question: **what are some examples of scenius in recent
times?** Here's a few that seem like likely candidates:
  
+ In the 1970s
  [Xerox PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)) made
  crucial contributions to the development of laser printers, the
  mouse, windowing systems (and graphics more generally), the
  ethernet, and many more.

+ Pixar: 11 of Pixar's 12 feature films have been critical and
financial successes.  For the most part they're not to my taste, but
clearly Pixar has figured out something which virtually none of the
other studios have.

**Is there a rich frontier to mine?** Think of painting at the end of
  the 15th century.  Painting at the start of the 20th.  Quantum
  computing in the early 1990s.  Physics in the 1920s.  The internet
  (especially the web) in the 1990s.  Possibly also today.  In each
  case there were major frontiers on which it had become possible to
  make rapid progress.

**How to recognize scenius?**

**What's going to be important in 10-15 years' time? Are there
  high-concentration communities doing interesting work in the area
  today?** Space, robotics, 
  
**The problems of high-prestige, fashionable, or rich fields:** My
empirical observation is that the density of stimulating people to
learn from in these fields is often low.  A possible reason is that
these are fields in which it is relatively easy to do well, and so
attractive to lots of people who want to coast.  When money is pouring
into a field, so will the people who just want to take the easy way.
When prestige or fashionability is pouring into a field, so too will
the poseurs.

Consider, by contrast, the case of Camp 4 at Yosemite.  Climbers at
Camp 4 will often make a living by collecting and recycling aluminium
cans. They'll live off boiled rice and peanut butter.  They're not
doing it for the money.  And they're not doing it because it's
fashionable or prestigious in the wider society.  Rather, they have a
shared ideal of what matters, and they believe so strongly in it

The counterpoint to this argument is that lots of very smart, very
determined people will also be in these fields.

**A corollary to the above is to look for communities that are held
 together by something other than fashion, money, or prestige:**
 Often, they'll be held together by a shared ideal, or something else
 that is shared.  Is what is shared awareness of a frontier?  Do the
 people in it
 
 
**What isn't scenius?** If something is fashionable or there's lots of
  money to do it (or both).  This causes an inrush of poseurs and
  9-to-5ers.  

**Is Google an example of scenius?** Maybe there are places inside
  Google where that's true.
  

**It doesn't come out of companies:** I do wonder . Many of
  Michaelangelo's greatest works were, of course, produced on
  commission.

**People get the credit for what they do**

  

  
**Phil Agre:** Agre has pointed out (somewhere, I haven't tracked down
  the location) that an excellent way to identify emerging fields is
  to ask smart undergraduates what they're interested in, and then to
  eliminate the already-fashionable answers.  In what remaisn

# Appendix: was Florence a statistical fluke?

Suppose we assume the genius hypothesis as true, and believe that
someone will achieve greatness as a painter with a fixed probability,
say p = 1 in ten million, independent of their environment.  Then in a
community of n = 100,000 people, the probability of having k or more
great painters (k a small positive integer) is approximately:
  
(np)^k / k! = (1/100)^k / k!
  
When k = 4, this probability is less than one in a billion.  And so if
the genius hypothesis is true, then Florence is far outside the bounds
of what can be expected statistically.
  
Of course, the outcome here depends a lot on exactly what we mean for
a painter to be "great".  If we adopt more modest standards, say p = 1
in a million, then the probability above increases quite a bit, to
about 1 in a quarter million.  This is still too small -- there have
not been anything like a quarter million such communities in history
-- but is at least getting closer to statistical plausibility.  The
problem is that if we adopt this value of p, then we're saying that we
expect a great painter to emerge from about 1 city in every 10 of size
100,000.  While some notable painters will likely come out of such a
collection of cities, I frankly think that's far too modest a
criterion.  So we can confidently reject the genius hypothesis.
