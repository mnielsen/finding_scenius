The artist Brian Eno has
[defined](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
a notion of "scenius": 

"Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole
cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius."

It's not difficult to think of examples of scenius.  

Florence in the 15th century had approximately 100,000 inhabitants.
The people born in (or just outside) Florence in that time include
Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Donatello, and a
host of lesser but still great painters.

How great a clustering of painters was this?

Numerical attempts to quantify the value of creative work are always
arguable, and I don't want to get caught up in arguing over details.
However, let us conservatively grant that several of these painters
could reasonably be listed among the 100 greatest painters of all
time.  For example, four of them appear on
[this list](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/most-important-painters.htm).
A modern country of, say, 100 million inhabitants, might, if it were
lucky, produce more than four painters of such quality during a
century.  But it is almost inconceivable that it would produce (say)
40 such painters.

In other words, if you were an artist who aspired to be considered a
great painter, you upped your chances by a factor of perhaps a
thousand by the good fortune of being born in Florence in the 15th
century, rather than (say) in North American in the 20th century.

**Scenius is causative:** An interesting contrast to Florence is the
small town of Los Alamos during World War II.  Living in the town were
scientific luminaries such Feynman, Fermi, Bethe, and (on occasion)
Bohr and von Neumann.

This is a galaxy of talent not unlike Florence in the 15th century.
But, of course, the environment in Los Alamos could not be said to
have _created_ such talent.  Most of the luminaries in town were
already exceptionally accomplished _before_ going to Los Alamos.
Perhaps the environment did make some positive difference to their
future accomplishments, but it seems unlikely that it was primarily
the environment which caused their future accomplishments.

By contrast, the great painters of Florence that I named above were
all born in Florence, or in the countryside nearby.  And so in some
sense it really was living in Florence during the 15th century which
helped _cause_ these people to become much better painters.
  
**Two hypotheses:** Let me set up two hypotheses about how works of
  great distinction are produced.  One is the _genius hypothesis_.
  This is the idea that what makes someone like Michaelangelo great is
  some intrinsic quality of that person.  According to this
  hypothesis, he could have been brought up in another small town of
  100,000 and he still would have been an artistic superstar.  The
  other is the _scenius hypothesis_, which states that while intrinsic
  properties are important, at least as important
  
**Scenius is not merely a statistical fluke:** Many communities
  contain artists.  And even if you believe the genius hypothesis,
  then you would expect, just by the luck of the draw, that some
  otherwise similar communities would contain more outstanding artists
  than others.  Maybe Florence was just a statistical fluke?  It's
  hard to make this case, however.  In the appendix I set up a simple
  statistical model to test this idea.  What we find is that it is not
  even remotely plausible that Florence was simply a statistical
  fluke.
    
**Wasn't it just that Florence was the right place at the right
  time?** In this explanation, we say that a few things came together:
  (1) the ideas, techniques and technologies of art had advanced to a
  point where it opened up a whole new world of artistic
  possibilities; (2) Florence already had a community of artists who
  were already on the leading edge (true); and (3) the success of the
  Medici and other families created a business model to support
  artistic endeavours.

These observations suggest many questions.  But I think they suggest
one thing in particular, for the ambitious: **if you want to improve
your chances of doing great things, then find scenius**. What else
increases your chance of doing great things by a factor of 1,000 or
more?  One must have a modicum of talent, a 

The question then becomes: **how to find scenius?**

**It's usually not something that is fashionable to do:**

*It's usually not something which is high prestige:*

*Look for communities that are held together by something other than
 fashion, money, or prestige:*  


**But how to recognize scenius?**


**What about the founder effect?**

**Where is scenius today?** Let's look first at the related question:
  **what are some examples of scenius in recent times?** Here's a few:
  
+ In the 1970s
  [Xerox PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)) made
  crucial contributions to the development of laser printers, the
  mouse, windowing systems (and graphics more generally), the
  ethernet, and many more.

+ 


**Is Google an example of scenius?** Maybe there are places inside
  Google where that's true.

**The distinction between the grand plan and the

**What isn't scenius?** If something is fashionable or there's lots of
  money to do it (or both).  This causes an inrush of poseurs and
  9-to-5ers.  Consider, by contrast, the case of Camp 4 at Yosemite.
  Climbers at Camp 4 will make a living . They'll live off boiled rice
  and peanut butter.
  

**It doesn't come out of companies:** I do wonder . Many of
  Michaelangelo's greatest works were, of course, produced on
  commission.


**Appendix: was Florence a statistical fluke?** Suppose we regard the
  genius hypothesis as true, and believe that someone will achieve
  greatness as a painter with a fixed probability, say p = 1 in ten
  million, independent of their environment.  Then in a community of n
  = 100,000 people, the probability of having k or more great painters
  (k a small positive integer) is approximately:
  
  (np)^k / k! = (1/100)^k / k!
  
  When k = 4, this probability is less than one in a billion.  And so
  if the genius hypothesis is true, then Florence is far outside the
  bounds of what can be expected statistically.
  
  Of course, the outcome here depends a lot on exactly what we mean by
  "great".  Another way of saying how small p is, relative to
    
  
  Of course, the outcome here depends a lot on how exactly you choose
  the value for p to correspond to greatness.  Choose
