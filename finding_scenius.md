# Finding scenius

_Rough working notes on scenius._

The artist Brian Eno has
[introduced](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
a notion of collective intelligence that he calls "scenius":

> "Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole
> cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the
> genius."

Kevin Kelly has a
[stimulating blog post](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
in which he discusses what scenius is, and proposes some ideas about
how it's nurtured:

> Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and
> produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like
> genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire
> you.

As an example, conside the town of Florence in the 15th century.  At
the time it had perhaps 100,000 inhabitants.  That's a tiny number,
but included Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico,
Donatello, and a host of lesser but still great painters.

![Michaelangelo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michelangelo-Buonarroti1.jpg)

How remarkable a clustering of painters was this?

Numerical attempts to value creative work are always arguable, and I
don't want to get caught up in arguing over details.  However, let us
conservatively grant that several of these painters would be listed
among the 100 greatest painters of all time.  For example, four of
them appear on
[this list](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/most-important-painters.htm).
A modern country of, say, 100 million inhabitants, might, if it were
lucky, produce more than four painters of such quality in a century.
But it is almost inconceivable that it would produce (say) 40 such
painters.

In other words, if you were an artist who aspired to be considered a
great painter, you upped your chances by a factor of perhaps a
thousand by the good fortune of being born in Florence in the 15th
century, rather than (say) in North America in the 20th century.

We often think in terms of people such as Michaelangelo, Botticelli
_et al_ being born with extraordinary, one in a million (or more)
levels of talent.  But the lesson of Florence is that this is wrong.
These people were more like one in 10,000 types of talent.  Indeed,
they were probably far less: after all, painting was closed as a
career to the great majority of Florentines, most of whom were of the
wrong gender, or too poor, or faced some other near-insurmountable
barrier.

What truly set Michaelangelo _et al_ apart wasn't talent.  It was
their great good fortune in being in the right place at the right
time.  Their genius derived from scenius.

## Is scenius really the _cause_ of genius?

Can we really claim that scenius _caused_ Florence's 15th century
outbreak of artistic genius?  Maybe some other causal factor was
responsible?

To see what I mean, consider a case where it _seems_ as though scenius
was occurring, but upon closer examination that explanation seems
unlikely.  The example is the project to build the atomic bomb,
carried out in the small town of Los Alamos during World War II.
Living in town at the time were scientific luminaries such Feynman,
Fermi, Bethe, and (on occasion) Bohr and von Neumann, as well many
other scientists and engineers of great distinction.

This is a galaxy of talent not unlike Florence in the 15th century.
But, of course, the environment in Los Alamos did not _create_ such
talent.  Most of the luminaries in town were already exceptionally
accomplished before going to Los Alamos.  Perhaps the environment did
make some positive difference to their future accomplishments, but it
seems unlikely that it was primarily the environment which caused
their future accomplishments.

By contrast, the great painters of Florence named above were all born
in Florence, or in the countryside nearby [*].  And so it really was
living in Florence during the 15th century which _caused_ these people
to become better painters.

I suspect that many other examples of supposed scenius are more like
Los Alamos -- great aggregations of talent that will flourish no
matter what -- than Florence, where just being in Florence at the
right time seemed to help produce much better creative work.  I
suspect this is at least partially true of
[Bloomsbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group), for
example, and of the [Inklings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings).

## Was Florence just at the tail end of the distribution?

Another way of countering the scenius hypothesis is to wonder whether
ordinary statistical variation might explain the existence of a town
like Florence.  After all, the world has contained many communities of
100,000 people through history.  And some of those communities will
contain an unusually large number of excellent artists, just by the
luck of the draw.  Maybe the reason for Florence's success wasn't
scenius, it was luck. _Some_ community had to have the most great
artists, and maybe it just happened to be Florence.

In the appendix I use a statistical model to test the idea that
Florence was just lucky.  In particular, I test the _genius
hypothesis_, the idea that what makes a great artist such as
Michaelangelo is some intrinsic property of the artist, not the
environment in which he found himself.  According to this hypothesis,
Michaelangelo could have been brought up in another small town of
100,000 and, provided the town had some sort of artistic community, he
would still have matured into a great artist.

What I show in the appendix is that it's not possible to account for
the creativity we find in Florence, even by the luck of the draw.
Instead, we must take seriously the _scenius hypothesis_, i.e., the
notion that while intrinsic properties are important, the environment
in which a creative type works may be far more important.

## Maybe Florence was just the right place at the right time?

Imagine it is the 18th century.  You are living in New York and you
hear the first news of a major gold strike in California.  Many people
rush out to California, dig for gold, and an unusually large fraction
become wealthy.  Should we conclude from this that there was some
special scenius in California that imbued those people with a special
talent for generating wealth?  Were they picking up special
wealth-generating skills from their friends and colleagues?

The answer, obviously, is no, it would be wrong to attribute the
wealth to anything particularly important in the social environment.
Rather, they chose to put themselves in the right place at the right
time.

You can make a similar case for Florence.  There is a sense in which
the 15th century Florence was a rich frontier waiting to be mined for
great art, not unlike the mining of gold in the California gold
fields.  At least three factors contributed to Florence being such a
frontier: (1) it had been a leading European center for art for
hundreds of years; (2) the rise of the Medici family created a
business model to support a large number of artistic endeavours; and
(3) the ideas, techniques and technologies of art had advanced to a
point where they opened up a whole new world of artistic
possibilities.

Any one of these three facts would not have been enough to establish
Florence as pre-eminent not just in its time, but arguably for all
time.  But with all three factors occurring simultaneously, Florence
became _the place_ to be for ambitious artists.

This explanation for Florence's pre-eminence is subtly different from
Eno's explanation of scenius.  It's not that the great painters of
Florence were learning and benefiting from each other.  Instead, in
this explanation they were more like gold miners who just happened to
be first on the scene, just as a new vein of gold was found.

This is what might be called the _rich frontier_ hypothesis of genius:
there's a huge advantage to getting in very early as a rich frontier
is opening up.  There are relatively few other people present
initially, and so not only pioneers stake a major claim, they're often
able to remain ahead of the curve for many years or decades, even as
the field matures.

So now we have an interesting question.  How much were the great
Florentine artists benefiting from being at a rich frontier, and how
much were they benefiting from a rich social environment?  I don't
think it's at all clear what he answer to this question is.

How does this affect our notion of scenius? 

There are two paths we could take at this point.  One is to adopt a
narrow notion of scenius as the benefit a creative worker gets from
their social scene.  I'm prety sure this is how Eno intended it, and
it's certainly how Kevin Kelly discusses it.  If we adopt this notion
of scenius then it explicitly excludes the rich frontier.  Any attempt
to explain Florence and similar events must engage the question of the
relative contribution of both scenius and the rich frontier.

The other approach is to embrace a broader notion of scenius which
includes both the benefits from working at a rich frontier _and_ the
benefit from a rich social environment.  In this essay, I'm going to
adopt this broader notion of scenius.  I'll still occasionally find it
helpful to break out both components of scenius --- the rich frontier
and the rich social scene.

A lot of what I've said so far seems like bland truisms. Yes,
environment matters.  Yes, being in the right place at the right time
matters.  Everyone can trivially agree with these statements.  But
they acquire force when contrasted with other supposely obvious
truisms.  Most people think great creative achievement requires
supreme talent.  But the moral of the Florence Renaissance is that
it's better to be moderately talented and in the right place at the
right time than it is to be supremely talented and in the wrong place
at the wrong time.  

This over-emphasis we have on talent is enormously destructive.  It's
not exactly a myth --- different people do have different levels of
talent.  But it's such a tiny part of the overall picure, and we
overemphasize talent at the expense of other, more important things.
If Michaelangelo had grown up today in a Florence-sized town, he'd be
a well-known local artist, admired within a small sphere, but
forgotten by history [1].
  

## The problems of "scenius"

The term "scenius" has significant problems.  It inherits many
romantic overtones from the term "genius", overtones which make it
easy to misuse "scenius" in a way that is vague and wishy-washy.  The
empty platitude "she was a genius piano player" can become "she was
part of an enormous eruption of scenius in music in her town". Both
are equally devoid of explanatory power.

Despite these problems, scenius reminds us forcefully that it's not
just individual talent that matters.  It's at least as important to be
working in the right area at the right time, and in a rich and
stimulating environment.  And these things make scenius worth thinking
about in depth.

In part because of this problem I'm going to alternate, sometimes
using the term scenius, but also talking about a "great scene" on
occasion.  The latter is more concrete, and reminds us that scenius
isn't some mysterious property, but rather means something meaningful.

## Appendix: Isn't it a waste of time to talk about these squishy, vague ideas?

There's a best-selling self-help book by Steven Covey entitled "The
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People".  It's about what you'd
expect --- advice on how to live a better and more effective life.
Linus Torvalds once
[stated his opinion](http://lwn.net/Articles/105375/) of Covey's book
in no uncertain terms:

> I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly Successful People", and
> NOT read it.  Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture.
  
Torvalds's comment illustrates the attitude many technical people have
about discussions of "soft" human-centred subjects.  And I'm acutely
aware that this essay fits this bill just as much as do books such as
Covery's.  We don't yet have a science which answers questions such as
how to live an effective and meaningful life, how to create a great
creative scene, and so on.  But such questions still matter, and so
self-help books and essays rack up sales and pageviews.
  
Many in the intellectual elite sneer at such self-help as
witch-doctory.  "It's not real science", they say.  True.  But, and
here's the rub, they _can't point to obviously superior solutions_.
And just because we don't yet have a good science of these questions
doesn't mean we get to opt out of answering them.  The right question
isn't whether Covey and his ilk are witch doctors.  Rather, when you
only have witch doctors to choose from, you want to make darn sure you
find the best witch doctor available.

This phenomenon has led to something interesting: psychologists and
sociologists are colonizing self-help, writing books making much of
the fact that they're REAL SCIENCE as a marketing credential.
Unfortunately, the results are often oversold, the evidence and
reasoning little better than in any other books.  In another century
or two I expect we'll genuinely _know_ a lot about these sorts of
questions.  But for now, the "scientific" self-help books seem little
more trustworthy than any other.  We're stuck trying to find high
quality witch doctors, regardless of whether they have PhDs, MDs, or
simply a charismatic personality and writing style.

For all these reasons I was somewhat hesitant to write this essay.
I'm well aware that we're still at the stage of just-so stories in
understanding things like scenius.  Still, I believe that it's worth
thinking hard about these questions, no matter how imperfect and
uncertain the results may be.  Just because a question is difficult is
no reason to refrain from attempting to answer it.

## Appendix: Was Florence a statistical fluke?

Suppose we assume the genius hypothesis as true, and believe that
someone will achieve greatness as a painter with a fixed probability,
say p = 1 in ten million, independent of their environment.  Then in a
community of n = 100,000 people, the probability of having k or more
great painters (k a small positive integer) is approximately:
  
(np)^k / k! = (1/100)^k / k!
  
When k = 4, this probability is less than one in a billion.  And so if
the genius hypothesis is true, then Florence is far outside the bounds
of what can be expected statistically.
  
Of course, the outcome here depends a lot on exactly what we mean for
a painter to be "great".  If we adopt more modest standards, say p = 1
in a million, then the probability above increases quite a bit, to
about 1 in a quarter million.  This is still too small -- there have
not been anything like a quarter million such communities in history
-- but is at least getting closer to statistical plausibility.  The
problem is that if we adopt this value of p, then we're saying that we
expect a great painter to emerge from about 1 city in every 10 of size
100,000.  While some notable painters will likely come out of such a
collection of cities, I frankly think that's far too modest a
criterion.  So we can confidently reject the genius hypothesis.

## Appendix: Characteristics of scenius

While drafting these notes I spent considerable time attempting to
list characteristics of scenius.  Kevin Kelly has a list of such
characteristics in his
[blog post](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php):

> + Mutual appreciation -- Risky moves are applauded by the group,
>   subtlety is appreciated, and friendly competition goads the
>   shy. Scenius can be thought of as the best of peer pressure.
>
> + Rapid exchange of tools and techniques -- As soon as something is
>   invented, it is flaunted and then shared. Ideas flow quickly
>   because they are flowing inside a common language and sensibility.
>
> + Network effects of success -- When a record is broken, a hit
>   happens, or breakthrough erupts, the success is claimed by the
>   entire scene. This empowers the scene to further success.
>
> + Local tolerance for the novelties -- The local "outside" does not
>   push back too hard against the transgressions of the scene. The
>   renegades and mavericks are protected by this buffer zone.

Such lists are interesting and stimulating.  But I found myself
uncomfortable as I attempted to list such characteristics.  What bugs
me is that such characteristics seem more like _consequences_ of
scenius than _underlying causes_.  I'm much more interested in the
mechanics of scenius than I am in the external characteristics.

Because of this I'll list just two characteristics, both of which seem
very close to the underlying mechanics of scenius.

First, scenius requires _a high density of dedicated people_.  The
people in a great scene don't need to be supremely talented, but they
must be dedicated and fearless, ambitious to create.  Michaelangelo
wasn't coasting.

Second, _the creative frontier is large, relative to the number of
people involved_.  A field that is fun and stimulating when 50 people
are involved may become overcrowded with 5,000 people.  People get
squeezed into tiny boxes, pursuing tiny dreams.  They start to feel as
though there is more competition, even if there are actually more
resources per capita.  As a result they become more selfish, less
helpful, and less willing to share.  Outside your immediate colleagues
you are less buoyed by others.

I had an experience like this.  I worked in quantum computing from
1992 through 2007.  And even though far more resources were available
per person to do quantum computing in 2007, the field also felt (to
me) like it was much more competitive, because while the number of
people had exploded, the intellectual frontier had not.


## Appendix: Scenius and the adjacent possible

The author [Steven Johnson](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/) has
developed the idea of the _adjacent possible_ [*] in his book
[Where Good Ideas Come From](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594487715/stevenberlinj-20).
The adjacent possible is the set of ideas, discoveries and inventions
that we've _nearly_ made.  They're just waiting to happen, on the tip
of our collective tongue.  In Johnson's words in the
[Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838.html)
(adapted from the book):

> The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the
> edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which
> the present can reinvent itself.

> The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that
> its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens

> that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room
> with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven't visited

> opening new doors and eventually you'll have built a palace.

An example of the adjacent possible is Einstein's development of his
Special Theory of Relativity.  If you know nothing about the history
it sounds like a miraculous breakthrough: Einstein shows up and tells
the world that time, space, mass and energy are all radically
different than we thought!  But if you look in detail at the history,
Einstein's work is really an incremental step building on the work of
his contemporaties and immediate predecessors.  People such as
Maxwell, Michelson, Morley, Lorentz, Fitzgerald and Poincaré had
already realized that the speed of light might behave oddly in
different reference frames, and that something might therefore be
wrong with our intuitive notions of space and time.  Einstein built in
part on their results, just as they built on their predecssors.  This
is not to undervalue Einstein's work.  But his work was within the
adjacent possible at the time.  

It's tempting to think the adjacent possible is just about low-hanging
fruit.  But that's not quite the right way to think.  As an example,
[quantum teleportation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation)
was discovered in 1993.  Technically, it's an extremely simple use of
the ideas of quantum mechanics.  It could likely have been discovered
in the 1920s, and certainly in the 1930s, by which time physicists
were routinely doing far more complex quantum mechanical calculations.
But they weren't asking the kind of questions that would lead to the
discovery of quantum teleportation. Those questions didn't arise until
a new narrative connecting physics and information was developed in
the 1970s and 1980s.  It was that narrative --- not any technical
breakthrough --- which dramatically expanded the adjacent possible.
The new narrative stimulated many new questions and research
directions, which could be answered with existing technical ideas (the
principles of quantum mechanics).

There is a close connection between scenius and the adjacent possible.
Let me return to Johnson's analogy of the expanding house:

> Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new
> combinations. Think of it as a house that magically expands with
> each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each
> leading to a new room that you haven't visited yet. Once you open
> one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors
> appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn't have
> reached from your original starting point.

Mostly, when we make discoveries, it's like opening a door into a room
with a few more doors.  But occasionally people make platform
discoveries that dramatically expand the adjacent possible.  It's like
opening the door to a new room, and discovering a giant hall with
thousands of doors.

A good example of a platform innovation was the introduction of the
http protocol and the web browser, circa 1990.  It was a simple piece
of technology.  But it dramatically expanded the adjacent possible,
opening up a rich frontier.  This, in turn, created the conditions for
scenius to emerge.

And so one possible test  for scenius is whether the adjacent possible
has tremendously  opened up.  You  can ask: "Is the  adjacent possible
tremendously exciting?"  If the answer is obviously yes --- if you can
see or guess that there are thousands of rich questions, waiting to be
answered,  within reach  ---  then that's  a  clear signal  of a  rich
frontier, and  good grounds for the emergence  of scenius.  Sometimes,
of course, the answer _isn't_ yes  --- you can't see all the questions
waiting to be answered.

There's a connection here to how most of us work.  When looking for
new projects it's tempting to look only at the adjacent possible
within domains we've already mastered.  That's not always a bad idea.
But if we do it all the time, then we'll always be staying in the same
scene.  Another strategy is to take a step back and to get more of the
big picture.

In a sense, the way to do deep work is to specialize, and to focus
hard, continually improving your skills within some domain.  But the
way to work on the right stuff is to be a serious dilettante, someone
who moves from field to field, not just skimming, but digging down
intensively enough down a little.

[Andre Gheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Geim), the
co-discoverer of graphene, has a lab tradition of "Friday-afternoon
experiments" --- simple, playful experiments, often in areas he
doesn't know well.  Most of the experiments don't work well.  But
sometimes they're notable.  Geim say both his IgNobel prize work (for
magnetically levitating a frog) and his Nobel prize work (for
graphene) started with such experiments.  Geim says:

> Many people chose a subject for their PhD and then continue the same
> subject until they retire. I despise this approach. I have changed
> my subject five times before I got my first tenured position and
> that helped me to learn different subjects.

In other words, he balances his deep, intensive work with wide-ranging
exploration.  Or consider the following
[story](http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/84n3/ivory.html) about
the great string theorist Ed Witten, told by a friend of Witten's from
the 1970s:

## Brushes with scenius

I've had two extended brushes with scenius.

The first was in the field of quantum computing.  I worked on quantum
computing from 1992 to 2007.  From 1992 to 1994 I only had contact
with a few people in the quantum computing community.  But in 1995 and
especially 1996 I became a part of the international community of
scientists working on quantum computing.

The (theoretical) quantum computing scene at that time was amazing.
From 1993 through 1996 saw the invention of quantum teleportation, the
fast quantum factoring algorithm, the fast quantum search algorithm,
quantum data compression, quantum error-correction, fault-tolerant
quantum computing, and topological quantum computing.  All of these
are Nobel or near-Nobel level achievements, in my opinion [*].  And
they came out of a scientific community that, over most of that time,
could get together in a single small room.

Three things stand out, in retrospect.  

First, at the time I didn't understand that anything remarkable was
underway.  This was partially due to my youth: from 1993 to 1996
corresponds to the years I was 19 to 23.  I just thought that's how
science was done.  I shared offices or collaborated with many of the
discoverers of the above phenomena, and thught little of it.  I wasn't
yet scientifically mature enough to make a comparable contribution.

XXX

My second brush with scenius is merely a suspicion, at present,
because I don't have the same historical and emotional distance.  From
2007 to now I've concentrated my creative work on open science.  It's
too early to say what the impact of open science will be.  But I hope
that from the viewpoint of history the recent efforts will be seen as
having helped initiate a major transformation in how science is done.
They've been more scattered and diffuse than efforts in quantum
computing.

[*] This is not to say that all or indeed any of these will ever
result in Nobel prizes.  Just that if I went to sleep tomorrow and
woke up in 2050 I wouldn't be surprised to see any of the above on a
list of Nobel prizes, or similarly prestigious awards.


## Appendix: Is the internet still a rich frontier?

Over the past decade I've heard many people say that the internet is
over, and that the great emerging frontier is clean energy, or space,
_etc_.

My instinct is that these people are wrong.  Not wrong to say that
clean energy and space are great emerging frontiers; they certainly
are.  But wrong to think that the internet is over.
  
There are huge problems that remain to be solved online.  We're a long
way from networking every object and every event in the world.  We're
drowning in human co-ordination problems.  We're drowning in data
analysis problems.  And we're still a long way from artificial
intelligence.
  
Maybe there's insurmountable bottlenecks that will stop progress
toward all these goals.  But, at least today, progress on each
continues to hum along, and convincing bottlenecks hard to spot.  To
paraphrase
[Alan Kay](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf), the real
internet revolution hasn't happened yet.
	  
One sign of this is the many low-hanging fruit which remain.  

For instance, it surprises me how little work there is on developing
new internet protocols and new server and client software.  Danny
Hillis once
[observed](http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Hillis.html) that
the web --- i.e., the http protocol --- is "the slime mold of the
Internet".

That summary seems exactly right.  Sure, the web and other existing
protocols such as email and so on are neat.  But it's not as though
we've done more than begin exploring what can be done with distributed
user interfaces.  Few communities are even exploring this in depth.
One which is is the online gaming community, and games such as World
of Warcraft start to show how remarkable distributed user interfaces
can be.  But while that work is interesting, it's not leading to new
open platforms.  We only see a trickle of work on developing new open
platforms --- things like
[BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and
[SPDY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY).  Those things are great,
but there's much less than I'd _a priori_ expect.

## Footnotes

[1] I wonder about the importance of feedback effects.  The Florentine
  Michaelangelo must have realized that he had an opportunity to be
  one of the great artists of all time.  That may have motivated him
  to work far harder (and thus become a better artist) than if all he
  could hope for was to be a well-known local artist.  The same is
  true of many leaders in other fields.  The best way to sail is with
  the wind at your back.

[*] Leonardo was also born in the Florentine countryside, and began to
paint under the tutelage of a Florentine artist, and could arguably be
included on my list of great Florentine painters.  But much of his
mature work was produced elsewhere, so I have omitted him.

Brand said it in conversation with Marvin Minsky, but don't recall
where.

[*] The term "adjacent possible" is originally due to the biologist
[Stuart Kauffman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman), who
applied it to biological systems.

# Attempt

> _I look at the edge to see where the center is going._ --
> [Stewart Brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) [*], one
> of our best scenius hounds (and instigators)

I'm interested in scenius for a personal reason.  I recently completed
a major, years-long project, and so I'm searching for good, new
projects to work on.  Scenius isn't my only criterion, but it's on my
mind.  All other things being equal, I'd rather work on a project at a
rich, underpopulated frontier, in a fantastic environment that buoys
me up.
 
So I'm asking myself the question: where is scenius nascent today?
And I've realized that I don't have more than a vague idea of where
scenius is nascent today.
  
Sure, I know of many interesting emerging fields.  A partial list, in
no particular order, includes 3d printing, synthetic biology,
connectomics, gaming and virtual worlds, open science, robotics,
self-driving cars, space, augmented reality, wearable computing,
online education, cognitive tools, the maker and DIY movements.  There
are also corners of big data, machine learning and programming
language design that are interesting.

But looking at that list, most of the things on it are pretty
mainstream.  Once an idea has appeared on ted.com, it's no longer at
the edge, it's moving toward the middle, and mainstream acceptance.  I
can't help but feel that scenius is probably in areas edgier than any
of these, areas I've never heard of.

Going mainstream dilutes scenius.  People rush in as money and
prestige become available.  This creates a problem because it
increases the density of people who just want to coast, riding the
coattails of pioneers; it increases the density of people whose main
interest is money and prestige; and it increases the density of people
who are unwilling to work on the unconventional.  None of this
promotes scenius.  Meanwhile, the scope of the frontier --- of the
[adjacent possible](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838.html),
in Stephen Johnson's wonderful useage --- expands far more slowly than
the inrush of people. People's piece of the creative pie shrinks, even
as their access to resources expands.  And so they become more
competitive, less willing to boost others up.

A particularly pernicious form of this is our cultural obsession with
high-prestige, fashionable, or rich fields and organizations.

Just look at all the books and glossy magazine articles extolling the
virtues of Google, private space ventures, Apple, open education, and
so on -- you can fill in your own examples here!  If you believe
what's written these fields and organizations are creative nirvana.

I think it's quite a bit more complicated than the laudatory publicity
suggests.

I've no doubt Google, say, has many good and even great engineers.
But at the same time I doubt there are more than few small parts of
the organization today which match the intensity of good ideas
produced by Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, and the MIT AI Lab in their heyday.
In the early days, no question --- Google was a relatively small
company which produced search, gmail, fundaental systems for
distributed computing.  But today, even as Google has grown by orders
of magnitude, the rate of major innovations has not correspondingly
increased.  Their success has created a major inrush of people into
the company, and made it a fashionable, high-prestige place to be.
But most of those people are working to maintain and incrementally
improve what GOogle already does.  And so the density of scenius
across the company has inevitably decreased.

Are there corners of Google today which are just as remarkable as the
early Google?  I don't know.  But events such as Google Wave's failure
are encouraging.  It was a huge, swing-for-the-fences idea that
contained many good ideas, and very nearly worked.  If Google
continues developing such ideas, then it seems likely to me that
they'll sometimes swing for the fences and succeed.

That notwithstanding, my point about the density of scenius falling
remains.  The lesson is that going in an _ad hoc_ fashion to a big,
fashionable place is a bad idea.  You should only do that if you have
inside inforomation, telling you which are the great, innovative
groups inside an organization or field.



# Notes


  

## What should I actually do?

**What should I actually do?** Maybe write a series of articles.
  Frankly, I think it's actually.  Maybe more agressively link.  Ask
  people for their ideas of where scenius is to be found?  I think
  there's that alternating series.  Go into fields where you are a
  learner.  Look for young people to learn from.  Older creative
  people suffer a form of the sunk cost fallacy: they continue to work
  in creative fields, even when those fields are no longer as exciting
  as frontiers.  There's a widespread suspicion that older people
  aren't as creative.  I don't think that's becase they're old.  I
  think it's in part because of the sunk cost fallacy, regression
  toward the mean, and, most important negativ network externalities.
  
Things which bug me:

**The tension between exploration and deep work:** Very few people are
good at finding scenius.  And to do so they need to explore a lot.
They become journalists --- like the people working on the Whole Earth
Catalog.  And there's a real tension between such exploration and
doing deep creative work.  Do I really believe this?  Brand and
several of the other Whole Earthers have done deep work.  Maybe it's a
question of alternating.  Maybe you spend some time doing a
"reconaissance in force" of several areas, writing articles, doing
interviews, trying to find the interesting edges.  And then you pick a
deep project to commit to, something that will take a few years.  I
think it was Chandrasekhar who said that it took two years to do
significant work, so he kept changing fields every two years, and then
picking some new and important problem to be working on.  I seem to
recall Brand saying something similar.

**WOndering whether my horizons are broad enough?** I'm painfully
  aware of how narrow my horizons are.  Maybe I should be looking to
  things I know little about --- the developing world, materials
  science, and other such things?  On reflection, I think I'm
  suffering from a fallac here.  The point isn't to take a complete
  inventory of scenius.  It's to find it in a few places, and then to
  pursue a promising project which has just opened up in the adjacent
  possible, and to which I feel equal.  That said, there's a lot to be
  said for broadening my horizons.  But I shouldn't feel any necessity
  to get a complete picture; no-one ever will.

**Going deep:** It's really all about identifying wonderful project
  possibilites in the adjacent possible.  Should the scene come first,
  or the project idea?

**Either commit to exploring full out, or else make a commitment to
  doing deep work in some area.**

**How I'm framing this:** I'm framing this as a choice: do deep work
  or find scenius.  But you can alternate.
  


**Some part of me wants to light on out, and do an exploration to find
out what's interesting in the world.** Where is scenius today?  If you
want to go beyond bland platitudes,

    
    


## Creating Scenius

If I'm uncomfortable talking about characteristics of scenius, I am
even more uncomfortable talking about how to build organizations and
institutions which create scenius.

institutional design.

Desire of many leaders the world over.  "next SIlicon Valley" etc.

## Scenius anti-patterns


**Prestige, fashion, and barriers:** One problem is that when a field
becomes prestigious or fashionable, or a lot of money is available,
then people who just want to coast arrive in droves.  There's an
inrush of poseurs and 9-to-5ers.  It requires high barriers to keep
those people out.

**Jobs and high barriers:** Walter Isaacson's
[recent biography of Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537)
shows that one of Jobs's main functions at Apple was to act as a human
barrier, either firing or driving away people who weren't superb at
their job.  This no doubt had many negative consequences.  But it's
also part of the reason Apple maintained a very good core team,
despite being high prestige.

**Open, but with high standards:** Anyone can join.  But they may have
  to pay a price.  Furthermore, their work will ultimately be judged
  by very high standards.  Those standards are ultimately grounded in
  something meaningful to the outside field, not merely the internal
  politics of the field.  I've seen academic and artistic communities
  become a prisoner to their internal politics.  It's a bad sign when
  you frequently hear people's work being criticised on the grounds
  that "It's not foo fizzle pop", where "foo fizzle pop" seems only
  meaningful to insiders.

**Open, but with ruthless standards:** Or maybe the right way of
  thinking.  It's an old observation that there is no democracy of
  talent.  More important, to my mind, is that there there's no
  democracy of...

**Do you need some selection process for quality?** Yes, a ruthless
  one.  Ideally, one that will concentrate the best people in the same
  locations, but at the same time not dissuade them from being
  friendly with one another, and supporting one another.




**The right types of failure are encouraged:** When a scene is still
 small, people know each other.  They know when someone is a foolish
 dreamer with low standards, and when someone is a smart dreamer who
 both gets things done and holds themself to high standards.  The
 latter will be forgiven if they come up short, and and perhaps even
 celebrated if much was learn through the failure.
 

**A corollary to the above is to look for communities that are held
 together by something other than fashion, money, or prestige:**
 Often, they'll be held together by a shared ideal, or something else
 that is shared.  It may just be shared awareness of a frontier.
 
An example is the case of Camp 4 at Yosemite.  Climbers at Camp 4 will
often make a living by collecting and recycling aluminium
cans. They'll live off boiled rice and peanut butter.  They're not
doing it for the money.  And they're not doing it because it's
fashionable or prestigious in the wider society.  Rather, they have a
shared ideal of what matters, and they believe so strongly in it that
they're willing to live this way, pushing the frontier of climbing.




## Other notes



**Structure: multiple appendices:** This essay has XXX appendices.  If
  this were a magazine article they'd be boxes in the text: they're
  mini-articles that didn't fit into the main part of the essay.  I
  could have spun them out into separate blog posts, but they would
  have lost important context.  So I've opted instead for a loose
  integration.

**Queston for my readers: where is scenius nascent today?** So I will
conclude this main part of my essay by asking my readers: where is
scenius nascent today?  This is really a few different questions:

+ **What are the most important emerging fields?** Typically, these
are fields that have just opened up because of some other advance or
advances.

+ **Where are the best environments to work in?  Why?** Beware the
distinction between great PR and branding, and real success.  MIT is a
great brand, but individual groups at MIT will span the full range
from superb creative incubators to complete dead ends.  All will
appear glossy outwardly, and be quoted in the _New York Times_ as
though they have equal authority.


  



**Scenius radar:** Some people have amazing scenius radar.  Consider
Stewart Brand. Here's a list of fields, institutions and people he
identified _before_ they became famous: Doug Engelbart, LSD, ecology,
the Grateful Dead, Xerox PARC, Paul Ehrlich, the hippy movement.  That
list could be continued almost _ad infinitum_; over the last fifty
years if you wanted to know "What's interesting?" then you could do a
lot worse than answer "Whatever Stewart Brand is paying attention to
right now".

I don't know how Brand did this.  But I'll bet it helped that he ran
the Whole Earth Catalog.  It's purpose was pretty much to _find_ the
most interesting stuff going on.





 

**Advantage of being high prestige:** An advantage of being high
prestige is that also attracts many very smart, very determined people
will be interested in participating.  The problem is that those people
will be a tiny subset of an avalanche of others.  Creating a great
environment will require very good filters, both in terms of who you
accept, and in terms of who you drive away.
    
The counter-argument is that lots of very smart, very determined
people will also be in these fields.  My gut feeling is that while
this is true, the density becomes relatively low.  Not as low as in
many other fields, of course, but it's not amazing: it's not Florence
in the 1400s, or Los Alamos in the 1940s.


**Ownership at the edges, not at the center:** I suspect it matters
that things like Unix and C were produced by XXX, not by "Bell Labs".

**Might it only be founders-only?** Maybe **early-employees only?** Is
  there much evidence for that?
    



**The characteristics of scenius:** Kelly has a list.  It's mismatched
  to mine, since he has a different conception of scenius.  I'd change
  his list anyway.  But for my approach, which splits scenius into two
  pieces, a different type of list is needed anyway.
  
  
**Choose a rich, underpopulated frontier.  And then find a community
where very smart people are helping one another open that frontier.**
A difficult balancing act then ensues.  You need to both learn as much
as possible from those people, but also to begin developing your own
identity.

What you want: a high density of dedicated people pursuing a rich
frontier.  And you want the size of the frontier to dwarf the number
of people involved.




**Phil Agre:** The information scientist Phil Agre has proposed an
  interesting way to identify important emerging fields. He suggested
  asking the very smartest undergrads what they're interested in, and
  making a list of their replies. Cross the already fashionable
  answers (cosmology, nanotech etc) off the list. Look instead for
  fields that you've never heard of, that sound strange, and slightly
  off the wall. Some of those fields will fail, of course. But chances
  are that some of biggest fields a decade or two hence will be on
  that list.



**What's going to be important in 10-15 years' time? Are there
  high-concentration communities doing interesting work in the area
  today?** Space, robotics, energy.



 

**Other places:** Where in academia?  What do I think of academia in
  this context, generally?  What about public intellectualism?
  Probably not.  Most public intellectuals are providing new answers
  to old, classic questions.  Scenius is often concerned with new
  questions.  The narrative isn't yet even known by the mainstream.



**Does it come out of companies?** Sometimes it does.  And it's often
  done for commercial reasons.  Many of Michaelangelo's greatest works
  were, of course, produced on commission.  I think a problem with
  companies is that people in them often don't get the credit for what
  they do, and they often have to fit into someone else's tighty
  controlled narrative.  Neither is good for doing excellent work.
  Furthermore, the incentives facing the company often favour
  incremental maintenance work, not investing in rich frontiers.
    

**Brainstorming questions:** How to find scenius?  Where is scenius
  today?  How to create scenius?  How to recognize scenius?  xI have a
  practical question: what impact should it have?

There are two natural questions to ask at this point.  If you are
still not yet decided on a career, and ambitious to do great creative
work, then you should ask **how to find scenius**.  After all, what
else increases your chance of doing great things by a factor of 1,000
or more?  The second natural question is **how to create scenius**?
Although I have many thoughts about the second question, I am going to
focus on the first.

The question then becomes: **how to find scenius?** And to answer
that, the we can ask **Where is scenius today?** Let's look first at
the related question: **what are some examples of scenius in recent
times?** Here's a few that seem like likely candidates:
  
+ In the 1970s
  [Xerox PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)) made
  crucial contributions to the development of laser printers, the
  mouse, windowing systems (and graphics more generally), the
  ethernet, and many more.

+ Pixar: 11 of Pixar's 12 feature films have been critical and
financial successes.  For the most part they're not to my taste, but
clearly Pixar has figured out something which virtually none of the
other studios have.


**Identifying promising subject areas is not the same as identifying
  high-concentration communities doing great work.**
  
**Public relations:** Part of the problem is public relations.  It's
  easy to be wowed by the pubicity coming from an organization such as
  SpaceX.  And maybe it really is a great place, a place that is
  enabling its engineers and scientists to grow by leaps and bounds.
  Equally well, maybe it's all a few brilliant engineers, and everyone
  else is a drone.  It's hard to know from the outside.



**What am I trying to do in the essay?** I'm not sure.  Partially I'm
  just exploring a fascinating phenomenon for anyone interested in
  human achievement or human institutions: the clustering of talent.
  Why does it happen?  What does it mean?  Are there interesting
  hypotheses about the clustering that we can rule in or out?

  Partially I'm interested for much more personal reasons. I'm trying
  to figure out what _I_ should be doing.  There are two problems with
  this: (1) it's very personal, and it's hard to write about personal
  stuff; and (2) it's incomplete: am I writing about scenius, or about
  how to choose work?  Because of this there is a natural pull to make
  this merely _part_ of a much larger and more ambitious essay on how
  to choose work.  But that feels like more than I can or want to bite
  off at present.
  


**Is there a rich frontier to mine?** Think of painting at the end of
  the 15th century.  Painting at the start of the 20th.  Quantum
  computing in the early 1990s.  Physics in the 1920s.  The internet
  (especially the web) in the 1990s.  Possibly also today.  In each
  case there were major frontiers on which it had become possible to
  make rapid progress.


**State Lehrer's problem:** Empircally, great outbursts of talent
  really do occur.  And we can .  Is there some way of designing
  institutions
  
**Look at some of the people Lehrer citse.**

**Add some CC images: Michaelangelo.  Los ALamos.  The people there.
  Etc.**

**Make the notion of scenius as concrete as possible.** Images are
  good.  This is part of what makes Camp 4 a good example.
