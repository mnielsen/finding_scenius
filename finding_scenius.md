# Finding scenius

_Rough working notes on scenius._

The artist Brian Eno has
[introduced](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
a notion of collective intelligence that he calls "scenius":

> "Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole
> cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the
> genius."

Kevin Kelly has a
[stimulating blog post](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php)
in which he discusses what scenius is, and proposes some ideas about
how it's nurtured:

> Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and
> produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like
> genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire
> you.
>
> The geography of scenius is nurtured by several factors:
>
> + Mutual appreciation -- Risky moves are applauded by the group,
>   subtlety is appreciated, and friendly competition goads the
>   shy. Scenius can be thought of as the best of peer pressure.
>
> + Rapid exchange of tools and techniques -- As soon as something is
>   invented, it is flaunted and then shared. Ideas flow quickly
>   because they are flowing inside a common language and sensibility.
>
> + Network effects of success -- When a record is broken, a hit
>   happens, or breakthrough erupts, the success is claimed by the
>   entire scene. This empowers the scene to further success.

> + Local tolerance for the novelties -- The local "outside" does not
>   push back too hard against the transgressions of the scene. The
>   renegades and mavericks are protected by this buffer zone.

As an example, conside the town of Florence in the 15th century.  At
the time it had perhaps 100,000 inhabitants.  That's a tiny number,
but included Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico,
Donatello, and a host of lesser but still great painters.

How remarkable a clustering of painters was this?

Numerical attempts to value creative work are always arguable, and I
don't want to get caught up in arguing over details.  However, let us
conservatively grant that several of these painters would be listed
among the 100 greatest painters of all time.  For example, four of
them appear on
[this list](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/most-important-painters.htm).
A modern country of, say, 100 million inhabitants, might, if it were
lucky, produce more than four painters of such quality in a century.
But it is almost inconceivable that it would produce (say) 40 such
painters.

In other words, if you were an artist who aspired to be considered a
great painter, you upped your chances by a factor of perhaps a
thousand by the good fortune of being born in Florence in the 15th
century, rather than (say) in North America in the 20th century.

We often think in terms of people such as Michaelangelo, Botticelli
_et al_ being born with extraordinary, one in a million (or more)
levels of talent.  But the lesson of Florence is that this is wrong.
These people were more like one in 10,000 types of talent.  Indeed,
they were probably far less: after all, painting was closed as a
career to the great majority of Florentines, most of whom were of the
wrong gender, or too poor, or faced some other near-insurmountable
barrier.

What truly set Michaelangelo _et al_ apart wasn't talent.  It was
their great good fortune in being in the right place at the right
time.  Their genius derived from scenius.

## Is scenius really the _cause_ of genius?

Can we really claim that scenius _caused_ Florence's 15th century
outbreak of artistic genius?  Maybe some other causal factor was
responsible?

To see what I mean, consider a case where it _seems_ as though scenius
was occurring, but upon closer examination that explanation seems
unlikely.  The example is the project to build the atomic bomb,
carried out in the small town of Los Alamos during World War II.
Living in town at the time were scientific luminaries such Feynman,
Fermi, Bethe, and (on occasion) Bohr and von Neumann, as well many
other scientists and engineers of great distinction.

This is a galaxy of talent not unlike Florence in the 15th century.
But, of course, the environment in Los Alamos did not _create_ such
talent.  Most of the luminaries in town were already exceptionally
accomplished before going to Los Alamos.  Perhaps the environment did
make some positive difference to their future accomplishments, but it
seems unlikely that it was primarily the environment which caused
their future accomplishments.

By contrast, the great painters of Florence named above were all born
in Florence, or in the countryside nearby.  And so it really was
living in Florence during the 15th century which _caused_ these people
to become better painters.

## Was Florence just at the tail end of the distribution?

Another way of countering the scenius hypothesis is to wonder whether
ordinary statistical variation might explain the existence of a town
like Florence.  After all, the world has contained many communities of
100,000 people through history.  And some of those communities will
contain an unusually large number of excellent artists, just by the
luck of the draw.  Maybe the reason for Florence's success wasn't
scenius, it was luck. _Some_ community had to have the most great
artists, and maybe it just happened to be Florence.

In the appendix I use a statistical model to test the idea that
Florence was just lucky.  In particular, I test the _genius
hypothesis_, the idea that what makes a great artist such as
Michaelangelo is some intrinsic property of the artist, not the
environment in which he found himself.  According to this hypothesis,
Michaelangelo could have been brought up in another small town of
100,000 and, provided the town had some sort of artistic community, he
would still have matured into a great artist.

What I show in the appendix is that it's not possible to account for
the creativity we find in Florence, even by the luck of the draw.
Instead, we must take seriously the _scenius hypothesis_, i.e., the
notion that while intrinsic properties are important, the environment
in which a creative type works may be far more important.

## Maybe Florence was just the right place at the right time?

Imagine it is the 18th century.  You are living in New York and you
hear the first news of a major gold strike in California.  Many people
rush out to California, dig for gold, and an unusually large fraction
become wealthy.  Should we conclude from this that there was some
special scenius in California that imbued those people with a special
talent for generating wealth?  Were they picking up special
wealth-generating skills from their friends and colleagues?

The answer, obviously, is no, it would be wrong to attribute the
wealth to anything particularly important in the social environment.
Rather, they chose to put themselves in the right place at the right
time.

You can make a similar case for Florence.  There is a sense in which
the 15th century Florence was a rich frontier waiting to be mined for
great art, not unlike the mining of gold in the California gold
fields.  At least three factors contributed to Florence being such a
frontier: (1) it had been a leading European center for art for
hundreds of years; (2) the rise of the Medici family created a
business model to support a large number of artistic endeavours; and
(3) the ideas, techniques and technologies of art had advanced to a
point where they opened up a whole new world of artistic
possibilities.

Any one of these three facts would not have been enough to establish
Florence as pre-eminent not just in its time, but arguably for all
time.  But with all three factors occurring simultaneously, Florence
became _the place_ to be for ambitious artists.

This explanation for Florence's pre-eminence is subtly different from
Eno's explanation of scenius.  It's not that the great painters of
Florence were learning and benefiting from each other.  Instead, in
this explanation they were more like gold miners who just happened to
be first on the scene, just as a new vein of gold was found.

This is what might be called the _rich frontier_ hypothesis of genius:
there's a huge advantage to getting in very early as a rich frontier
is opening up.  There are relatively few other people present
initially, and so not only pioneers stake a major claim, they're often
able to remain ahead of the curve for many years or decades, even as
the field matures.

So now we have an interesting question.  How much were the great
Florentine artists benefiting from being at a rich frontier, and how
much were they benefiting from a rich social environment?  I don't
think it's at all clear what he answer to this question is.

How does this affect our notion of scenius? 

There are two paths we could take at this point.  One is to adopt a
narrow notion of scenius as the benefit a creative worker gets from
their social scene.  I'm prety sure this is how Eno intended it.  If
we adopt this notion of scenius then it explicitly excludes the rich
frontier.  Any attempt to explain Florence and similar events must
engage the question of the relative contribution of both scenius and
the rich frontier.  

The other approach is to embrace a broader notion of scenius which
includes both the benefits from working at a rich frontier _and_ the
benefit from a rich social environment.  In this essay, I'm going to
adopt this broader notion of scenius.  I'll still occasionally find it
helpful to break out both components of scenius --- the rich frontier
and the rich social scene.

A lot of what I've said so far seems like bland truisms. Yes,
environment matters.  Yes, being in the right place at the right time
matters.  Everyone can trivially agree with these statements.  But
they acquire force when contrasted with other supposely obvious
truisms.  Most people think great creative achievement requires
supreme talent.  But the moral of the Florence Renaissance is that
it's better to be moderately talented and in the right place at the
right time than it is to be supremely talented and in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

What you want: a high density of dedicated people pursuing a rich
frontier.  And you want the size of the frontier to dwarf the number
of people involved.

# How to find scenius

Where is scenius nascent today?

It's tempting to think scenius must be in the high-prestige,
fashionable, or rich fields or organizations. Just look at all the
books and glossy magazine articles which have been written extolling
the virtues of Google, Apple, private space ventures, and so on (fill
in your favourite example here!)

I think it's quite a bit more complicated than the laudatory publicity
suggests.

I've no doubt Google has many good or even great engineers.  But at
the same time I doubt there are many parts of the organization which
match the intensity of good ideas produced by Bell Labs, Xerox PARC,
or the MIT AI Lab in their heyday.  Why is that?  And how can we find
those places today?

I think it's worth understanding

One problem is that when a field becomes prestigious or fashionable,
or a lot of money is available, then people who just want to coast
arrive in droves.  It requires high barriers to keep those people out.
  
Walter Isaacson's
[recent biography of Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537)
makes it clear that one of Jobs's main functions at Apple was to act
as a human barrier, either firing or driving away people who weren't
superb at their job.  This no doubt had many negative consequences.
But it's also part of the reason Apple maintained a very good core
team, despite being high prestige.
  
An advantage of being high prestige is that also attracts many very
smart, very determined people will be interested in participating.
The problem is that those people will be a tiny subset of an avalanche
of others.  Creating a great environment will require very good
filters, both in terms of who you accept, and in terms of who you
drive away.
    
The counter-argument is that lots of very smart, very determined
people will also be in these fields.  My gut feeling is that while
this is true, the density becomes relatively low.  Not as low as in
many other fields, of course, but it's not amazing: it's not Florence
in the 1400s, or Los Alamos in the 1940s.


What really matters: the density of people 


I don't know where scenius is
  nascent today.  I have my suspicions.  Very interesting areas
  include: robotics, 3d-printing, energy, space, synthetic biology,
  gaming, virtual worlds, self-driving cars, augmented reality, the
  maker and DIY movements.
  
  Most probably it's in areas edgier than any of these, areas I've
  never heard of.

  But identifying promising subject areas is not the same as
  identifying high-concentration communities doing great work.
  
  Part of the problem is public relations.  It's easy to be wowed by
  the pubicity coming from an organization such as SpaceX.  And maybe
  it really is a great place, a place that is enabling its engineers
  and scientists to grow by leaps and bounds.  Equally well, maybe
  it's all a few brilliant engineers, and everyone else is a drone.
  It's hard to know from the outside.

Celebrating the right kind of failure.

## Is the internet still a rich frontier?

I've heard many people say that the internet is over over the past
decade, that the great emerging frontier is clean energy, or space,
_etc_.

My instinct is that these people are wrong.  Not wrong to say that
clean energy and space are great emerging frontiers.  But wrong to
think.  
  
There are huge problems that remain to be solved online.  We're a long
way from networking every object and every event in the world.  We're
drowning in human co-ordination problems.  We're drowning in data
analysis problems.  And we're still a long way from artificial
intelligence.
  
Maybe there's insurmountable bottlenecks that will stop progress
toward all these goals.  But, at least today, progress on each
continues to hum along, and bottlenecks sure seem hard to spot.  To
paraphrase
[Alan Kay](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf), the real
internet revolution hasn't happened yet.
	  
One sign of this is how many low-hanging fruit remain.  One thing that
shocks me is that there's so little work on developing new internet
protocols and new server and client software.  Danny Hillis once
[observed](http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Hillis.html) that
the web --- i.e., the http protocol --- is "the slime mold of the
Internet".  That seems exactly right.  Sure, the web is neat.  But
it's not as though we have well-developed distributed user interfaces.
(Actually, that's not entirely true: online games such as World of
Warcraft have remarkable distributed user interfaces.  But they're not
open platforms.)  We see some work on developing new open protocols
--- things like [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)
and [SPDY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) --- but much less than
I'd _a priori_ expect.

**What am I trying to do in the essay?** I'm not sure.  Partially I'm
  just exploring a fascinating phenomenon for anyone interested in
  human achievement or human institutions: the clustering of talent.
  Why does it happen?  What does it mean?  Are there interesting
  hypotheses about the clustering that we can rule in or out?

  Partially I'm interested for much more personal reasons. I'm trying
  to figure out what _I_ should be doing.  There are two problems with
  this: (1) it's very personal, and it's hard to write about personal
  stuff; and (2) it's incomplete: am I writing about scenius, or about
  how to choose work?  Because of this there is a natural pull to make
  this merely _part_ of a much larger and more ambitious essay on how
  to choose work.  But that feels like more than I can or want to bite
  off at present.
  
  Partially I'm interested in the question as an institutional design
  problem.
  
  I'm left in an uncomfortable position: I have what seem like many
  interesting observations.  But I don't have a natural frame to put
  them in.
  
  One possibility would be just to stop, to make the first part of the
  essay, above, the entirety of the essay, with some re-organization.
  But I feel like I can do better.
  
  Another possibility: just go with something cheap: "Five signs of
  scenius" or something like that.  Or maybe "Five signs you haven't
  found scenius".  I'm perhaps trying too hard to find a narrative
  thread, and should instead just tie things up, and let it go.

**Why do I feel discomfort with the whole essay?** I've talked a bit
  about this above.  But there are more reasons.
  
  There's a best-selling self-help book by Steven Covey entitled "The
  Seven Habits of Highly Effective People".  It's about what you'd
  expect --- advice on how to live a better and more effective life.
  Linus Torvalds once wrote of Covey's book: "XXX
  [random insulting remarks here]".
  
  Torvalds' comment sums up the attitude many technical people have
  about books on "soft" human-centred subjects, like how to live your
  life.  We don't have a science which answers questions such as how
  to spend one's time, how to deal with your spouse, and so on.  But
  such questions still matter, and so self-help books rack up millions
  of sales.
  
  Many in the intellectual elite sneer at such books as witch-doctory.
  But, and here's the rub, they _can't point to obviously superior
  solutions_.  There have been attempts by psychologists to colonize
  this field --- many write books using the fact that they're REAL
  SCIENCE as a marketing credential --- but the results are often
  oversold, the evidence and reasoning flimsy.  In one or two hundred
  years I expect we'll genuinely _know_ a lot about these sorts of
  questions.  But for now, the "scientific" self-help books seem
  little more trustworthy than any other.
       
  The problem is that just because we don't have a science of how to
  live, doesn't mean we get to opt out of questions like how to live a
  happy and interesting life.  The right question isn't whether Covey
  and his ilk are witch doctors.  Rather, when you only have witch
  doctors to choose from, you want to make darn sure you find the best
  witch doctor available.
      
  (Parenthetically, I've occasionally talked to the intellectual
  sneerers. I've noticed a few odd things.  When discussing questions
  like how to choose work, they'll often make extremely
  black-and-white statements supporting some obvious conventionalism.
  When pushed on _why_ they believe those things, they respond with
  flimsy or non-existent evidence.  Their commitment to evidence is
  often thin, disguising an inability to deal with not knowing.)
    
  In any case this essay deals with such soft issues, and because of
  that is making me feel some discomfort in talking publicly about
  such issues.  I feel the need to be bulletproof in my discussion,
  when of course is not feasible.  This kind of thing is necessarily
  speculative.

  


**A corollary to the above is to look for communities that are held
 together by something other than fashion, money, or prestige:**
 Often, they'll be held together by a shared ideal, or something else
 that is shared.  It may just be shared awareness of a frontier.
 
An example is the case of Camp 4 at Yosemite.  Climbers at Camp 4 will
often make a living by collecting and recycling aluminium
cans. They'll live off boiled rice and peanut butter.  They're not
doing it for the money.  And they're not doing it because it's
fashionable or prestigious in the wider society.  Rather, they have a
shared ideal of what matters, and they believe so strongly in it that
they're willing to live this way, pushing the frontier of climbing.

**Is there a rich frontier to mine?** Think of painting at the end of
  the 15th century.  Painting at the start of the 20th.  Quantum
  computing in the early 1990s.  Physics in the 1920s.  The internet
  (especially the web) in the 1990s.  Possibly also today.  In each
  case there were major frontiers on which it had become possible to
  make rapid progress.


# Appendix: was Florence a statistical fluke?

Suppose we assume the genius hypothesis as true, and believe that
someone will achieve greatness as a painter with a fixed probability,
say p = 1 in ten million, independent of their environment.  Then in a
community of n = 100,000 people, the probability of having k or more
great painters (k a small positive integer) is approximately:
  
(np)^k / k! = (1/100)^k / k!
  
When k = 4, this probability is less than one in a billion.  And so if
the genius hypothesis is true, then Florence is far outside the bounds
of what can be expected statistically.
  
Of course, the outcome here depends a lot on exactly what we mean for
a painter to be "great".  If we adopt more modest standards, say p = 1
in a million, then the probability above increases quite a bit, to
about 1 in a quarter million.  This is still too small -- there have
not been anything like a quarter million such communities in history
-- but is at least getting closer to statistical plausibility.  The
problem is that if we adopt this value of p, then we're saying that we
expect a great painter to emerge from about 1 city in every 10 of size
100,000.  While some notable painters will likely come out of such a
collection of cities, I frankly think that's far too modest a
criterion.  So we can confidently reject the genius hypothesis.

# Notes

Charactersistics:

A **high density** of dedicated people.  As I've argued above, they
don't need to be supremely talented, but they must be dedicated, and
ambitious to accomplish a lot.  Michaelangelo wasn't coasting.

A frontier that is large and rich, relative to the number.  If there
are just a few

Ownership at the edges, not at the center.  I think it matters that
things like Unix and C were produced by XXX, not by "Bell Labs".





**Feedback effects:** Michaelangelo at some point must have realized
  that he had an opportunity to be one of the great artists of all
  time.  That would have motivated him to work far harder.  How much
  harder did Michael Jordan practice at basketball once he realized he
  had it in him to be one of the great basketballers?  The best way to
  sail confidently is with a wind at your back.

**Phil Agre:** The information scientist Phil Agre has proposed an
  interesting way to identify important emerging fields. He suggested
  asking the very smartest undergrads what they're interested in, and
  making a list of their replies. Cross the already fashionable
  answers (cosmology, nanotech etc) off the list. Look instead for
  fields that you've never heard of, that sound strange, and slightly
  off the wall. Some of those fields will fail, of course. But chances
  are that some of biggest fields a decade or two hence will be on
  that list.

**How to recognize scenius?**

**What's going to be important in 10-15 years' time? Are there
  high-concentration communities doing interesting work in the area
  today?** Space, robotics, energy.


**The adjacent possible:**

**Teleportation was the adjacent possible for a long, long time:**
  It's tempting to think this is just about low-haning fruit.  But
  it's not.  Quantum teleportation is a simple enough protocol that it
  could have been discovered in the 1920s.  But it wasn't.  It had to
  wait until 1993.

 
**What isn't scenius?** If something is fashionable or there's lots of
  money to do it (or both).  This causes an inrush of poseurs and
  9-to-5ers.  

**However, there may still be identifiable sub-veins within those
  locations:**

**Is Google an example of scenius?** Maybe there are places inside
  Google where that's true.
  

**It doesn't come out of companies:** I wonder. Many of
  Michaelangelo's greatest works were, of course, produced on
  commission.  I think a problem with companies is that people in them
  often don't get the credit for what they do, and they often have to
  fit into someone else's tighty controlled narrative.  Neither is
  good for doing excellent work.
    

**Brainstorming questions:** How to find scenius?  Where is scenius
  today?  How to create scenius?  I have a practical question: what
  impact should it have?  

There are two natural questions to ask at this point.  If you are
still not yet decided on a career, and ambitious to do great creative
work, then you should ask **how to find scenius**.  After all, what
else increases your chance of doing great things by a factor of 1,000
or more?  The second natural question is **how to create scenius**?
Although I have many thoughts about the second question, I am going to
focus on the first.

The question then becomes: **how to find scenius?** And to answer
that, the we can ask **Where is scenius today?** Let's look first at
the related question: **what are some examples of scenius in recent
times?** Here's a few that seem like likely candidates:
  
+ In the 1970s
  [Xerox PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)) made
  crucial contributions to the development of laser printers, the
  mouse, windowing systems (and graphics more generally), the
  ethernet, and many more.

+ Pixar: 11 of Pixar's 12 feature films have been critical and
financial successes.  For the most part they're not to my taste, but
clearly Pixar has figured out something which virtually none of the
other studios have.

**Difficulty in writing about these issues:** It's difficult to write
about these issues.  Questions like "how to choose where you work" or
"what should you work on" are challenging questions.

**What question do I want to ask in the second half?**
      
**Paypal as an example?**

**Might it only be founders-only?** Maybe **early-employees only?** Is
  there much evidence for that?
  
**Do you need some selection process for quality?** Yes, a ruthless
  one.  Ideally, one that will concentrate the best people in the same
  locations, but at the same time not dissuade them from being
  friendly with one another, and supporting one another.


**OPen, but with ruthless standards:** Or maybe the right way of
  thinking .  It's an old observation that there is no democracy of
  talent.  More important, to my mind.


**The talent myth:** This idea of talent just seems utterly
  destructive.  If Michaelangelo had grown up in Waterloo, he'd be a
  talented local artist, admired within a small sphere, but not
  regarded as remarkable, and forgotten by history.

 
**What's wrong with the first half?**
